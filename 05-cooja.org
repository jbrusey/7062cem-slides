* Learning outcomes
- Familiarity with Cooja basics
- Know how to run and save a simple simulation
* What is Cooja? 
- Java-based Contiki network simulation
- Allows simulation of small and large networks
- Two types of motes can be simulated:
  - =cooja= motes run native code
  - =sky= motes emulate the hardware but simulation may be slower as a result
- You shouldn't need to adjust your code to run in simulation

* Getting started with Cooja
** Prerequisites
- While compiling Contiki doesn't require a windowing display, Cooja /does/
- Two options for this:
  - use VNC
  - install a desktop environment
- Try the instructions at https://github.com/contiki-ng/contiki-ng/wiki/Vagrant#provision-a-vm-with-a-desktop-environment

- Adjust the Vagrantfile to uncomment =vb.gui = true=
  #+BEGIN_SRC ruby
  config.vm.provider "virtualbox" do |vb|
    # Display the VirtualBox GUI when booting the machine
    vb.gui = true
  end
  #+END_SRC

- Run the bootstrap script for setting up X packages
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
$ ./contiki-ng/tools/vagrant/bootstrap-vbox-with-x.sh
#+END_SRC
- Reboot after the install
- I found that this added some virtualbox-guest packages which were then removed by vagrant's vbguest plugin
- If you don't end up with a graphical login prompt, don't worry---you can just run =startx= on the command line after logging in on the gui window.
- You may need to download the cooja submodules if you haven't already
  #+BEGIN_SRC sh
  $ cd ~/contiki-ng
  $ git submodule update --init --recursive
  #+END_SRC

** Create a new simulation
Follow the tutorial listed here: https://github.com/contiki-ng/contiki-ng/wiki/Tutorial:-Running-Contiki%E2%80%90NG-in-Cooja

If you encounter errors, try the fix suggested here: https://github.com/contiki-os/contiki/issues/2324

** Simple UDP RPL simulation
[[https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6550][RPL]] is the Routing Protocol for Low power and Lossy Networks

** Next steps

- Try the other simulation tutorials out until you feel you have a good understanding about what's going on.
- Review the code for the client and server and identify where messages are being sent and received.

* Summary
- We've covered getting the simulation gui up and running and running a basic simulation
- This tool should come in handy when you write your own code
