  Understand
  - the different parts that make up a typical IoT application
  - ethical issues that may arise
  - key constraints on what IoT can do

* Parts of an IoT Application

** The mote or node 

[[file:figures/tmote.jpg]]

  - Generally, all motes receive the same software 

** The border router

  - Also known as sink, gateway, or root node
  - Generally consists of a mote connected to the USB port of a PC
  - Can also be a Raspberry PI and mote
  - Converts protocols between mote network (e.g., RPL or 6LowPAN) and ordinary IP network
  - May require special software that is different from all other motes

** Message Queue

  - The Message Queue (e.g., MQTT) provides a connector between the source (motes) and sink (back-end database)
  - Publish / subscribe architecture is used
  - Security may be an issue and consider configuring passwords early in the design

** Web-server (CoAP)

  - CoAP is the Constrained Application Protocol (RFC7252)
  - It can be thought of as a REST web server approach
  - The CoAP server provides a HTTP style service and sits on a PC
  - Motes make CoAP /requests/ using GET, PUT, POST, DELETE verbs
  - The server responds with /responses/
  - See IoT in 5 days for more info.

** Rule-based systems (Node-RED, IFTTT)

  - Systems like Node-RED can subscribe to messages from MQTT
  - They can then transform and act on those messages
  - Node-RED is good for wiring systems together

* Ethical issues

** Considering privacy

  - If you are performing an `experiment', then standard ethical tests apply
    - participants must have informed consent
    - they must be able to opt out at any time
  - Information can often be derived indirectly:
    - Bathroom humidity might indicate when shower is in use
    - Bedroom CO2 sensors might identify sleep patterns or sexual activity
  - Participants should be anonymised

** Consider GDPR issues

  - Data protection provides guidance about what data should be stored and processed
  - Reprocessing data for a different purpose than the originally stated purpose is not allowed
  - Further reading is [[https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-data-protection/guide-to-the-general-data-protection-regulation-gdpr/][available]]

** Who owns the data?

  - Data ownership is often overlooked
  - Your contract may state that the data is owned by the company who employed you
  - When considering ownership, keep in mind GDPR reprocessing issues

** It shouldn't be up to the individual to decide

  - As a researcher or an employee, neither you nor your superior should decide what is ethical
  - There must always be a higher, independent authority
  - This might be a professional association, such as the IEEE, or a university ethics board

* Constraints

** Radio limitations

- Maximal transmission / reception distances are a factor of:
  - transmitter power
  - receiver power / sensitivity
  - radio frequency
  - building materials for any structures
  - interference

- Overall, expect typical IoT devices to have a range of around 20m indoors and about 100m outdoors

*** Transmission power
- IoT devices tend to operate with much less power than laptop WiFi and thus will have a smaller range
- Transmission power can be adjusted to help reduce power consumption

*** Radio frequency

- As with all electromagnetic waves, higher frequencies are blocked by solid objects whereas lower frequencies tend to pass through
- WiFi, BlueTooth, ZigBee and other IEEE 802.15.4 use the 2.4GHz ISM band

*** Building materials and shape

- Electrically conductive materials (water or metal) tend to absorb RF better than non-conductive materials (wood or air)
- In some cases, structures may help to extend the range slightly (e.g., in a long corridor)

*** Interference

- Many systems use the same ISM bands and interference is common
- Channel hopping approaches may help to bypass interference - particularly when operating near heavy machinery

** Network lifetime

  - How long a network lasts for without changing the batteries is an important factor for many applications
 
  - Power consumption is an important consideration and has been discussed in another lecture.

  - Energy harvesting may allow indefinite extension of the network life

  - Specialist batteries can improve lifetime also

  - Software approaches are another avenue for improving lifetime

*** Battery technology

  - Specialist batteries may help extend the life of a system

  - Main consideration for the battery is volume / weight and mAh rating

  - For energy harvesting consider lead-acid batteries (although these can be dangerous in some situations)

  - Rechargeable batteries will tend to have shorter lifetimes per charge cycle but last longer overall

*** Energy harvesting

  - Solar panels are inexpensive and reliable but you must also have a battery that you can charge to continue to operate overnight

  - Wind is less reliable

  - Supercapacitors can be used to smooth out small fluctuations

** Memory

  - Most motes have very limited memory and thus will restrict
    - code size
    - stored data
  - It may be possible to store more data in non-volatile flash memory
    - e.g., Telos mote has 1Mb flash

** Time accuracy

  - Motes generally have inaccurate clocks
  - Protocols such as TSCH (Time Synchronized Channel Hopping) may help
  - Assume that your mote clock is several seconds out
